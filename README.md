tcomb was a library for Node.js and the browser which allows you to **check the types** of JavaScript values at runtime with a simple and concise syntax. It's great for **Domain Driven Design** and for adding safety to your internal code.

Kcomb is an update of tcomb. 


STILL WIP , you can use it at your own risk.
